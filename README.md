# Mac-Macros
Most keyboards built for Windows have keys such as PrtSc, ScrLk, Pause, and Ins that are functionless in macOS.
Using .json files, users can make those keys output different combinations of keys.
An example is making PrtSc output to command + shift + 3, which is a screenshot in macOS.
But there really aren't any limits to what can be done; a user could make a modification as complex as he or she likes.
The macOS application Karabiner Elements allows users to implement their .json files using its Complex Modifications section.
This repository will be the place where I put the modifications I've made, and anyone should feel free to input their own.
